# BREAST_CANCER_PREDICTION

Overview
Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates. This project aims to develop a model system for breast cancer detection using medical data avaialble uploading a csv file or manually entering.

Usage
  1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/[Dhathri2005]/breast-cancer-detection.git
  2. Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
  3. Run the model: streamlit run app.py
     
Future Work
  1. Multi-class classification: Extend the model to classify different types of breast cancer.
  2. Segmentation: Implement image segmentation to identify tumor regions.
